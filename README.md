# Booper

Booper is a streamlined version of the r/place Reddit page, offering users a simplified experience.

Upon visiting the site, users are presented with a 4x4 grid of interactive buttons. Each button can be toggled between red and green states. Notably, this grid remains consistent for all usersâ€”any changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all others within approximately 3 seconds. Furthermore, the current state of each button is immediately visible to new visitors and those refreshing the page.
