# Booper

Booper is a streamlined version of the r/place Reddit page, offering users a simplified experience.

Upon visiting the site, users are presented with a 4x4 grid of interactive buttons. Each button can be toggled between red and green states. Notably, this grid remains consistent for all users—any changes made by one user are instantly reflected for all others within approximately 3 seconds. Furthermore, the current state of each button is immediately visible to new visitors and those refreshing the page.
